The correct answer is "It takes developers less time to implement a new feature from the first request to production."
This is correct because cycle time specifically refers to:

The total elapsed time from when work begins on a feature (first request) until it's delivered to production
The end-to-end process of feature development through deployment
The complete development lifecycle of a feature or change

The other options are incorrect because:

"Takes a company less time to implement a change" is too vague and doesn't specify the measurement points
"Takes an application less time to run" refers to application performance/execution time, not development cycle time

Lowered cycle times are a key metric in DevOps and continuous delivery, measuring how quickly teams can deliver value from start to finish of the development process.
